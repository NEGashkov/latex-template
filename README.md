# LaTeX Template

Simple LaTeX template for preparation of documentation or educational reports. There are main file, where all the package declaration lives and some tuning happens at `/main/main.tex` and subfiles at other directories, that should contain content of report.

## How To Use
Run `install-styles.sh` to install additional style files. For usage, go and inspect packages, that I use for PDF generation and adjust settings if necessary. Then add content to other files. Compile `main.tex` and you're all set.
